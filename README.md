# Heart Beat Estimator

## Introduction
Goal: Estimate the heart rate of an individual given a photoplethysmogram (PPG);
What is a photoplethysmogram?
Simple and low cost optical technique that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue.

PPG is a technology which determines blood volume pulse variation by measuring the amount of reflected light in the build in camera of smart devices. PPG senses teh temporal variation of light transmitted by and reflected from the human body due to the change in volume of blood vessels under the skin and oxygenation levels of the blood that occurs during respiration. The focus is on extracting the cardiac heart rate of the subject by analysing the color video signal and identifying periodic components.

For further details about the implementation please refer to the notebook in ppg/notebooks/first_analysis.ipynb.
